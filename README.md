Remote deployment will require you to specify some mandatory Evironment Variables,

- NAME: Name of the receiver.

- PIC: Url of the pic to be loaded in the card. If don't have the image hosted somewhere, you may publish a [telegra.ph article](https://telegra.ph) with your image and copy the image address from there.

To know more about the environment variables, check [References](#references).

### For Local Building

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Majeed-GitHub/Birthday-wish
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Add a pic of the receiver, in the `./local` directory. Ensure that the image is of 1:1 ratio or it might get cropped and squished.

4. Create a `.env` file in root directory, and add the following lines.

   ```env
    NAME='Name of the Receiever'
    PIC='name-of-image.extension'
   ```

5. Execute the following commands in order.

   ```sh
    npm run init-index-local
    npm run build:parcel
   ```

6. Upon Successful execution, your built files will be ready in the `./dist` directory. Open `./dist/index.html` to see the card.
